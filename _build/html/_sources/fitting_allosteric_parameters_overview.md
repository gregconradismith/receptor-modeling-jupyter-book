# Overview

After the allosteric parameters in a receptor dimer model are enumerated, the process of undestanding their effect on the properties of the dimer can begin.

Several different questions and workflows come to mind.

As a first example, consider a situation where there was high confidence in the topology and parameters for a receptor monomer.  In that case, one may ask whether or not there is experimental evidence from a measured binding curve for the dimer for any of the emergent allosteric parameters to be other than 1.
