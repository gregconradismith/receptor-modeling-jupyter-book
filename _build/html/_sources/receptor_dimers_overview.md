# Overview

When receptors function as two or more similar protein subunits working in concert (i.e., homodimers or oligomers), a composite receptor models must

* account for symmetry,
* satisfy thermodynamic constraints, and
* properly account for subunit interactions (allostery) mediated by conformational coupling.

For equilibrium models of receptor dimers, this approach facilitates the inference of a parsimonious subset of allosteric interactions leading to conformational coupling and dependence of receptor subunits.

Our first step is to introduce the concept of a [Cartesian product graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs), because this clarifies the structure of the state-transition diagram of a homodimer composed of two identical (but not necessarily independent) monomeric subunits.
