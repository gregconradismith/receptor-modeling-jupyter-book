    "Classical electrical network theory discusses using Wang algebra's to obtain co-spanning trees of an undirected simple  graph G from a cycle basis {cite}`Duffin59,Duffin74`.  A similar method involves obtaining directed spanning trees from the stars of G centered on each vertex save an arbitrary root {cite}`Chen1966directed`.    I will focus on the undirected case, because I wish to use the minimal cycle basis construction for reduced graph powers {cite}`HammackSmith17`. \n",
