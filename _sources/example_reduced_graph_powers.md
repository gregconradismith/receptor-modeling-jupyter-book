# Example Reduced Graph Powers  

Some understanding of reduced graph powers can be obtained by looking at examples.

For a simple graph $G=(V,E)$, we will sometimes write $|V(G)|$ and $|E(G)|$ 
for the number of vertices and edges of $G$.  We assume the graph $G$ is connected, so the Betti number is given by $\beta(G)=|E(G)|-|V(G)|+1$.   When the graph G   is understood from context, we will often use $v(G)$ and $e(G)$, or simply $v$ and $e$, for the number of vertices and edges of G.

The number of vertices in the reduced graph power $G^{(k)}$ is 

```{math}
|V(G^{(k)})|=\binom{v+k-1}{k} 
```

where $v=|V(G)|$.
The number of edges in the reduced graph power $G^{(k)}$ is  

```{math}
:label: edges
|E(G^{(k)})|=e\binom{v+k-2}{k-1}   
```

where $e=|E(G)|$.
When the graph $G$ is understood, will sometimes abbreviate the number of vertices and edges in its reduced graph power by $v^{(k)} = |V(G^{(k)})|$ and $e^{(k)} = |E(G^{(k)})|$.

## The path graph $P_n$

A `path graph` is a graph whose $n$ vertices can be listed in the order $0, 1, \ldots , n-1$ such that the edges are $(i, i+1)$ for $i = 0, 1 \ldots , n-2$.  For example,

```{code-cell}
for n in [2,4,7]:
    graphs.PathGraph(n).show(figsize=3,title='P%s:' %(n))
```

Evidently, $|V(P_n)|=n$, $|E(P_n)|=n-1$, and $\beta(P_n)=0$. 
The number of vertices of the reduced graph power $P_n^{(k)}$ is $|V(P_n^{(k)})|=\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. The number of edges is $|E(P_n^{(k)})|=(n-1)\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}$. Consequently, the Betti number of the path graph on $n$ vertices is  

```{math}
\begin{equation}
\beta(P_n^{(k)}) = (n-1)\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}-\binom{n+k-1}{k}+1 \, . 
\end{equation}
```

Specializing to the case of a dimer ($k=2$), we have $|V(P_n^{(2)})|=\binom{n+1}{2}$,  $|E(P_n^{(2)})|=n(n-1)$, and $\beta(P_n^{(2)}) = \binom{n-1}{2}$.

```{math}
:label: path_graph
\beta(P_n^{(k)}) = (n-1)\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}-\binom{n+k-1}{k}+1 \, . 
```

## The cycle graph $C_n$

The  `cycle graph` $C_n$ is a graph whose $n$ vertices can be listed in the order $0, 1, \ldots , n$ such that the edges are $(i, i+1)$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots , n-2$, 
and also $(0,n-1)$.  For example, $C_5$ is

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

for n in [3,5,12]:
    graphs.CycleGraph(n).show(figsize=3,title='K%s:' %(n))
```

For the cycle graph $|E(C_n)|=n$ and $\beta(C_n)=1$.

The number of vertices of the reduced graph power $C_n^{(k)}$ is $|V(C_n^{(k)})|=\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. The number of edges is $|E(C_n^{(k)})|=n\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}$. The Betti number is 

```{math}
\beta(C_n^{(k)}) = n\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}-\binom{n+k-1}{k}+1 \, . 
```

Specializing to the case of a dimer ($k=2$), we have $v^{(2)}=\binom{n+1}{2}$,  $e^{(2)}=n^2$, and 

```{math}
\beta(C_n^{(2)}) =  \binom{n}{2}+1 
= n(n-1)/2+1 \,.
```

## The complete graph $K_n$ 

The   `complete graph` $K_n$ is a graph with $n$ vertices and $|E(K_n)|=\binom{n}{2}$ edges.  
For example, $K_5$ is

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

for n in [2,4,7]:
    graphs.CompleteGraph(n).show(figsize=3,title='C%s:' %(n))
```

For the complete graph, $\beta(K_n)=\binom{n-1}{2}=(n-1)(n-2)/2$. 

The number of vertices of the reduced graph power $K_n^{(k)}$ is $|V(K_n^{(k)})|=\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, the number of edges is $|E(K_n^{(k)})|=\binom{n}{2}\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}$, and the Betti number is 

```{math}
\beta(K_n^{(k)}) = \binom{n}{2}\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}-\binom{n+k-1}{k}+1 \, . 
```

For a dimer ($k=2$), we have $v^{(2)}=\binom{n+1}{2}$,  $e^{(2)}=\binom{n}{2} n = n^2(n-1)/2$, and 

```{math}
\beta(K_n^{(2)}) = (n+1)(n-1)(n-2)/2 \, . 
```

## The hypercube graph $Q_n$

The `hypercube graph`  $Q_n$ has $|V(Q_n)|=2^n$ vertices and $|E(Q_n)|=2^{n-1}n $ edges.  For example, $Q_4$ is

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

for n in [2,4,5]:
    if n>3:
        graphs.CubeGraph(n).show(figsize=3,vertex_size=20,vertex_labels=false,title='Q%s:' %(n))
    else:
        graphs.CubeGraph(n).show(figsize=3,title='Q%s:' %(n))
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

n=3
graphs.CubeGraph(n).show3d(title='Q%s:' %(n))
```

For the hypercube graph, $\beta(Q_n)= 2^{n-1} (n-2)+1$.

The number of vertices of the reduced graph power $Q_n^{(k)}$ is $|V(Q_n^{(k)})|=\binom{2^n+k-1}{k}$.  The number of edges is $|E(Q_n^{(k)})|=2^{n-1} n \binom{2^n+k-2}{k-1}$. The Betti number is 

```{math}
\beta(Q_n^{(k)}) =2^{n-1} n \binom{2^n+k-2}{k-1}-\binom{2^n+k-1}{k}+1 \, .
```

The reduced graph product of two hypercube graphs, has $|V(Q_n^{(2)})|=2^{n-1} (2^n+1)$ vertices,  $|E(Q_n^{(2)})| = 2^{2n-1} n$ edges, and Betti number 

```{math}
\beta(Q_n^{(2)}) =  2^{2n-1} (n-1) - 2^{n-1}+1 \, . 
```

In particular, $\beta(Q_2^{(2)}) = 7$ and  $\beta(Q_3^{(2)}) = 61$.

## The bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$

The `complete bipartite graph` or `biclique`, denoted by $K_{n,m}$, 
is a bipartite graph where the vertices are partitioned into two sets.  Every vertex of the first set, $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$, is connected to every vertex of the second set, $\{n, n+1, \ldots, n+m-1\}$.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,4).show(figsize=3,title='K%s,%s:' %(3,4))
graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(5,7).show(figsize=4,title='K%s,%s:' %(5,7))
```

The complete bipartite graph has 
has $|V(K_{n,m})|=n+m$ vertices,  $|E(K_{n,m})|=nm $ edges, and Betti number

```{math}
\beta(K_{n,m})= nm-(n+m)+1 =  (n-1)(m-1) \, . 
```

The number of vertices of the reduced graph power $K_{n,m}^{(k)}$ is $|V(K_{n,m}^{(k)})|=\binom{n+m+k-1}{k}$. The number of edges is $|E(K_{n,m}^{(k)})|=nm\binom{n+m+k-2}{k-1}$.  This gives the Betti number 

```{math}
\beta(K_{n,m}^{(k)}) = nm\binom{n+m+k-2}{k-1} - \binom{n+m+k-1}{k} +1 \, . 
```

Specializing to the case of a dimer ($k=2$), we have $v^{(2)}= \binom{n+m+1}{2}$,  $e^{(2)}=nm (n+m)$, and 

```{math}
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta(K_{n,m}^{(2)}) & = &nm (n+m) - (n+m+1)(n+m)/2  +1 \\
& = & 
(n+m)[nm+(n-1)(m-1)]/2+1 \, . 
\end{eqnarray}
```
