# Welcome to __Receptors__

Test.

This [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) explores how cell surface receptors can be modeled using [Sagemath](https://www.sagemath.org), a free open\-source mathematics software system (see [https://www.sagemath.org](https://www.sagemath.org)).

The focus is Markov chain models of receptors and symbolic algebraic calculations of equilibrium and steady\-state kinetic occupancy measures \(i.e., the probability of each state\), as opposed to numerical methods to calculate steady states or time\-dependent dynamics.

After an brief introductory tutorial, we illustrate an approach to **modeling conformational coupling of receptor dimers and higher\-order oligomers** that was introduced in the following two papers.

* Richard H. Hammack and Gregory D. Smith, **Cycle bases of reduced powers of graphs**, *ARS Mathematica Contemporanea*, 12(1):183â€“203, 2017. [doi: 10.26493/1855-3974.856.4d2](https://doi.org/10.26493/1855-3974.856.4d2)
