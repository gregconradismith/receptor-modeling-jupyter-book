# Welcome to __Receptors__

This [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) is an introduction to mathematical modeling of cell surface receptors. 

This *Jupyter Book* titled **Receptors** gives examples of receptor modeling using [Sagemath](https://www.sagemath.org), a free open-source mathematics software system (see [https://www.sagemath.org](https://www.sagemath.org)). The focus of **Receptors** is enumerating allosteric parameters in receptor dimers and higher order oligomers.


The focus is Markov chain models \(discrete state, continuous time\) and symbolic calculations \(using [Sagemath](https://www.sagemath.org/)\) of equilibrium and steady\-state kinetic occupancy measures \(i.e., the probability of each state\), as opposed to numerical methods to calculate steady states or time\-dependent dynamics.

After introductory remarks, our emphasis is a particular approach to modeling of **conformational coupling of receptor dimers and higher\-order oligomers**.  The concepts and notation follow the following articles.
