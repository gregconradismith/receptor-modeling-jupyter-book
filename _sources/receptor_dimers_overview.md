A novel approach to **modeling conformational coupling of receptor dimers and higher\-order oligomers** that was introduced in the following two papers.

* Richard H. Hammack and Gregory D. Smith, **Cycle bases of reduced powers of graphs**, *ARS Mathematica Contemporanea*, 12(1):183â€“203, 2017. [doi: 10.26493/1855-3974.856.4d2](https://doi.org/10.26493/1855-3974.856.4d2)

When receptors function as two or more similar protein subunits working in concert (i.e., homodimers or oligomers), receptor models must

* account for symmetry,
* satisfy thermodynamic constraints, and
* properly account for subunit interactions (allostery) mediated by conformational coupling.

For equilibrium models of receptor dimers, this approach facilitates the inference of a parsimonious subset of allosteric interactions leading to conformational coupling and dependence of receptor subunits.

Our first step is to clarify the structure of the state-transition diagram of a homodimer composed of two identical (but not necessarily independent) monomeric subunits. The first step is to review the concept of a [Cartesian product graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs).
